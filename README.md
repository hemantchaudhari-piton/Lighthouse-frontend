# Lighthouse Base Web - Skill Education in Schools

## Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to New Lighthouse, Our Mission is to Integrate Vocational Education/Skill Development Programs into mainstream academia, providing underprivileged students with valuable skills for early employment.


## Architecture

Lighthouse is a multi-layered architecture, with each layer responsible for a specific task. The high-level architecture can be summarized as follows:

- **Frontend:** The Lighthouse frontend is a web application built with Angular. It is responsible for displaying the Lighthouse results and providing a user interface for interacting with the tool.
- **Backend:** The Lighthouse backend is a C# application built with ASP.NET. It is responsible for performing the Lighthouse audits and generating the results report.
- **API Gateway:** The API Gateway is a layer that sits between the front end and the back end. It is responsible for routing requests and responses between the two layers.
- **Database:** The Lighthouse database stores the Lighthouse results and other configuration data.
- **API Docs:**  [Lighthouse Service API Docs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/31510190/2s9YeHaqnz).

The Lighthouse architecture is designed to be scalable and extensible. The front end and back end can be scaled independently, and the API Gateway allows for new services to be easily added to the architecture.

## Installation

To set up the codebase you can follow these general steps:

1. Install the necessary software:</br>
   `Node.js`: < v16.13.2 </br>
   `NPM`: < v8.1.2 </br>
   `Visual Studio`: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. Clone the codebase from [Github](https://github.com/LAHI-Lighthoue/lighthouse-base-web.git)  to your local machine by following command-
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LAHI-Lighthoue/lighthouse-base-web.git
   ```

4. Now we need to download angular Cli by running this command-
   ```sh
   npm install -g @angular/cli@9.0.1
   ```

   
6. Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   to install the project's dependencies.

8. Now to start the frontend server we just need to run the following command-
   ```sh
   ng serve
   ```

Now you can visit [http://localhost:4213/login](http://localhost:4213/login) from your browser.

## New State Onboarding Process

**1. Request a New State Fork**

- To onboard a new state for a new lighthouse, start by requesting the Lahini development team to create a fork from the base repository.

**2. Clone and Customize**

- Once you have the forked repository, clone it from GitHub. Then, customize the code according to the specific requirements of the new state.

**3. Production Deployment**
- After completing the necessary customizations, initiate a production deployment to finalize the new state onboarding process.

## Syncing Lighthouse Base with Forked Repo

If you need to keep your forked repository in sync with the base repository, you can follow these steps:

**1. Sync with Base Changes**

- To update your forked repository with the latest changes from the base, use the "Sync Fork" option provided by GitHub. This will automatically synchronize your fork with the latest changes from the base repository.
- If you encounter merge conflicts during the synchronization, you can resolve them using GitHub CLI or other Git tools.

**2. Propagate Forked Repo Changes to Base**

- If you have made changes to your forked repository and want to incorporate them into the base repository, you can create a pull request in the forked repository. Make sure to set the base branch to the upstream branch. This action will also create a new pull request in the base repository.
- You can also achieve this using GitHub CLI or similar tools.
